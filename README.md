# Bookmark-Landing-Page
This project is a simple landing page for a bookmark manager.

## Challenge
The challenge was to come up with a landing page as close as possible to a figma design specification. Design specification is confidential and so we cannot include the link in this README.

## Motivation
This is a requirement for completion of the communicatio and development course for amalitech July 2021 cohort currently ongoing.

## Mark-up and styling language
HTML was used for mark-up and CSS was used for styling.

## Reason for choice of mark-up and styling langauges.
We are a team of one front-end engineer, two full-stack engineers and two data scientists. Given our various learning curricula at amalitech, HTML and CSS are the perfect balance between what we have all studied. Choosing HTML and CSS made the task easy and comprehensive for all members of the team.

## Strengths of the landing page
The landing page is best previewed on a desktop with maximum width of 1440px or mobile with maximum width of 375px. These were the requirements of the design specification.

## Limitations of the landing page
Other devices such as tablets are not fully catered for and so at some points, previewing the landing page on these devices breaks the page.
Due to the schedules of the various developers we have not been able to improve that in the meantime. But we will continue to improve the landing page through continuous delivery.
